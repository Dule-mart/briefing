# Welcome to Data Structures and Algorithms!



## Here, you will be training for your in-depth comprehension and logical thinking in DSA.

## RULES:

1. #### Be supportive, there will be no downbringing of others, we are here to grow together, not the other way around.

2. #### There will be a specific set of steps for submission of files, which will be explained later.

3. #### Since not everyone is on the same Timezone, we will have a loose deadline, for up to 48 hours, if specified.

## SUBMISSION (ASSUMING YOU UNDERSTAND GIT):

1. #### Clone the repo, ex: ```git clone https://github.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-DSA/briefing.git```

2. #### Make a new branch and change to that branch, ex: ```git checkout -b ricky```

3. #### Do your work on either of the file with the name ```solution``` in front.

4. #### Once you're done, add, commit and push to your own branch, steps: 

   1. ```git add .```

   2. ```git commit -m "I'm done with it"```

   3. #### ```git push origin ricky```

5. #### Go to ```git clone https://github.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-DSA/briefing``` and make Pull Request (PR)

6. #### Assign either ```RickyDoesCode``` OR ```dudesparsh``` as the ```asignees```.

7. #### You're done! Wait for us to leave feedback on your pull request and feel free to proceed to the next task!

8. #### Warning! Do Not Merge!

## If you have any difficulty, you can contact us on the WhatsApp Group or DM!
